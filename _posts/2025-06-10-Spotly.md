# **Spotly**

A location-based journal Android application designed to enable users to save memorable places and write stories or memories tied to specific geographical locations. Users can select a point on the map or search for specific locations, then add journal entries containing attributes such as title, category, narrative content, and emotion icons. All data is stored locally in an SQLite database on the device, ensuring complete offline access and management.

> **Mission:** Transform ordinary locations into meaningful memories through digital storytelling and precise geographical anchoring.

## **Project Overview**

Spotly represents a unique approach to digital journaling by combining geographical precision with personal storytelling. Unlike traditional journal apps that focus solely on chronological entries, Spotly creates a spatial narrative where memories are anchored to the exact locations where they occurred.

This application addresses the growing need for location-aware personal documentation in our increasingly mobile society, where significant moments often happen away from home and deserve to be remembered with geographical context.

## **Core Features**

**1. Interactive Map & Precise Location Selection**  
The application provides a responsive Google Maps interface where users can long-press on any point to select a location. This feature offers complete freedom to save highly specific and personal places, even those without formal addresses, such as:
- Favorite park benches
- Secret fishing spots  
- Street corners with the best views
- Hidden gems known only to locals

With this precision, users can ensure every memory is linked to exactly the right place, creating a truly personal geographical narrative.

**2. Rich Contextual Story Recording**  
Each selected location can be immediately enriched with a comprehensive story entry including:
- **Title**: Quick identification of the moment
- **Category**: Organizational grouping for different types of experiences
- **Narrative Content**: Detailed story or memory description
- **Emotion Icons**: Visual representation of feelings and mood

This functionality transforms a simple map point into a living, meaningful memory, making Spotly more than just a location markerâ€”it becomes your personal geographical autobiography.

**3. Smart Search (Online & Offline)**  
Users can easily find locations by typing names in the search field, powered by public APIs. The key advantage is the intelligent fallback system:
- **Online Mode**: Utilizes Google Places API for comprehensive location search
- **Offline Mode**: Automatically switches to search within previously saved stories and locations
- **Hybrid Functionality**: Seamless transition between online and offline modes

This ensures the application remains fully functional regardless of internet connectivity, keeping your data always accessible.

**4. Custom Folder Organization**  
As your collection of memorable places grows, the custom folder system helps maintain organization:
- Create personalized categories like "Must-Try Cuisine" or "Vacation Destinations"
- Easy navigation through grouped memories
- Quick retrieval of specific memory collections
- Personal playlist approach to life experiences

## **Technical Architecture**

**Database Design**

```sql
-- Locations Table
CREATE TABLE locations (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    latitude REAL NOT NULL,
    longitude REAL NOT NULL,
    address TEXT,
    place_name TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Stories Table  
CREATE TABLE stories (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    location_id INTEGER,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    category TEXT,
    content TEXT,
    emotion_icon TEXT,
    folder_id INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (location_id) REFERENCES locations(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (folder_id) REFERENCES folders(id)
);

-- Folders Table
CREATE TABLE folders (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### **Key Implementation Components**

**1. Google Maps Integration**
```java
// Map initialization and location selection
private void initializeMap() {
    SupportMapFragment mapFragment = (SupportMapFragment) getSupportFragmentManager()
            .findFragmentById(R.id.map);
    mapFragment.getMapAsync(this);
}

@Override
public void onMapReady(GoogleMap googleMap) {
    mMap = googleMap;
    mMap.setOnMapLongClickListener(latLng -> {
        selectedLocation = latLng;
        addLocationMarker(latLng);
        openStoryDialog(latLng);
    });
}
```

**2. SQLite Database Helper**
```java
public class DatabaseHelper extends SQLiteOpenHelper {
    private static final String DATABASE_NAME = "spotly.db";
    private static final int DATABASE_VERSION = 6;
    
    public DatabaseHelper(Context context) {
        super(context, DATABASE_NAME, null, DATABASE_VERSION);
    }
    
    @Override
    public void onCreate(SQLiteDatabase db) {
        // Create tables
        db.execSQL(CREATE_LOCATIONS_TABLE);
        db.execSQL(CREATE_STORIES_TABLE);
        db.execSQL(CREATE_FOLDERS_TABLE);
    }
}
```

**3. Offline Search Implementation**
```java
public List<Story> searchStoriesOffline(String query) {
    List<Story> results = new ArrayList<>();
    SQLiteDatabase db = dbHelper.getReadableDatabase();
    
    String selection = "title LIKE ? OR content LIKE ? OR category LIKE ?";
    String[] selectionArgs = {"%" + query + "%", "%" + query + "%", "%" + query + "%"};
    
    Cursor cursor = db.query("stories", null, selection, selectionArgs, null, null, "created_at DESC");
    
    while (cursor.moveToNext()) {
        results.add(cursorToStory(cursor));
    }
    cursor.close();
    return results;
}
```
